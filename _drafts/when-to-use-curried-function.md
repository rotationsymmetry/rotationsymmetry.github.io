title: When to Use Curried Function
comments: true
---
A friend of mine recently brought up the question of when to define a function in the curried style. Frankly speaking, I seldom use currying in my own projects. Sematically there is no real difference between calling a curried function and its uncurried counterpart. However, when we can consider this question in the context of Scala, I believe there are a few scenarios that currying is worth considering.

#### Implicit Parameters
#### Type Inference
#### DSL
